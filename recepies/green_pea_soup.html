        <p><strong>Description</strong> This is a recipe that I found in a vegetarian cookbook years ago. I have<br> modified it to my liking and have made it ever since. It's a hearty soup with a great <br>flavor.  Add seasonal veggies for more variety. Enjoy!
        <h3><strong>Ingredients</strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
                <li>1 large onion, halved and thinly sliced</li>
                <li>4 red potatoes, cubed</li>
                <li>½ pound green beans, cut into 1 inch pieces</li>
                <li> cups vegetable, chicken, or beef broth</li>
                <li> tablespoons whole wheat flour</li>
                <li> cup sour cream</li>
                <li>¾ cup sauerkraut with juice</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh dill</li>

        <h3><strong>Directions</strong></h3>
        <h4><strong>Steps</strong></h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat vegetable oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the onion, and gently cook until softened and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the potatoes and green beans; cook until the green beans have slightly softened, about 5 more minutes.</li>
            <li>Pour in the vegetable stock. Bring to a boil over high heat, then lower heat to medium-low, cover, and cook until the potatoes have softened, about 15 minutes. Stir the flour into the sour cream, and add it a spoonful at a time to the simmering soup. Stir in the sauerkraut and dill, season to taste with salt and pepper. Simmer for 5 minutes more before serving.</li>
        </ol>
